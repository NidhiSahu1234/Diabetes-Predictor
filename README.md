# Diabetes Predictor 🩺📊

A machine learning-based project aimed at predicting the likelihood of diabetes in patients using the PIMA Indian dataset. This project uniquely combines predictive modeling with Power BI for enhanced data visualization and interpretability.

## 💡 Project Overview
- Developed an ML model to predict diabetes using patient health attributes like glucose level, BMI, age, and insulin levels.
- Used Python (pandas, scikit-learn) for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- Evaluated multiple algorithms: Logistic Regression, KNN, and Decision Tree classifiers.
- Achieved reliable accuracy and performance using the confusion matrix and precision-recall metrics.

## 📊 Power BI Visualizations
- Led the data visualization component using **Power BI**.
- Created interactive dashboards to show:
  - Feature-wise distribution of diabetic vs. non-diabetic cases.
  - Correlation matrix of input features.
  - Model performance summary with easy-to-read visuals.
- Focused on presenting model outcomes in an interpretable, business-friendly format.

## 🎯 Key Highlights
- First team project experience: collaborated in a group of 5 members.
- Unique integration of **ML + Power BI** for real-world healthcare analytics.
- Enabled stakeholders to gain **clear, visual insights** into the model’s predictions.
